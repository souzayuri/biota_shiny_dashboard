Ecologists are constantly seeking to comprehend the factors that determine the species diversity and functionality of natural ecosystems. Defaunation, which refers to the extinction of animal species or populations on a local, global, or functional level, has a direct impact on the functioning of ecosystems. In 2010, we established a series of experimental plots (both fenced and open) to estimate the effects of the extinction of large terrestrial mammals on the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.

We are monitoring changes in soil carbon, nutrients, microbiota, gas emissions, plants, rodents, and invertebrate diversity in 86 pair-based plots in the continuous Atlantic Rainforests of Brazil. This project is part of the BIOTA FAPESP program. Here we make available the result of the 10-year Exclusion experiment of medium and large-sized mammals administrated by Professor **Mauro Galetti** [SÃ£o Paulo State University](https://unesp.br/portaldocentes/docentes/157124?lang=pt_BR).

This repository contains information about the location of each site and plot, forest structure, seedlings diversity, herbivory and morphological traits, seed predation, soil properties, and faunal biomass. From the left navigation panel, you will be able to access the descriptions, maps, and data and explore the data by plotting a linear regression and selecting the X and Y variables of interest. We also provide tools that allow you to choose between two different sampling years: 2017 and 2019. You can filter the data in the linear regression tab and download it by clicking at the bottom [**Download**] in the *Data Table* tab. You can and should use this dataset for educational activities only. For a quick walkthrough of the sample areas and experimental design please take a look at the video below.

If you have any questions about the data and its use, please contact one of the following researchers:
- Mauro Galetti: mauro.galetti@unesp.br
- Nacho Vilar: nachoprad@googlemail.com
- [Yuri Souza](https://souzayuri.github.io/): desouza.s.yuri@gmail.com

To read more about our results, please take a look at this Book Chapter: [Causes and Consequences of Large-Scale Defaunation in the Atlantic Forest](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348466339_Causes_and_Consequences_of_Large-Scale_Defaunation_in_the_Atlantic_Forest)
