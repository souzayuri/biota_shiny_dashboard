This dataset is part of the [*FAPESP-BIOTA*](https://fapesp.br/6259/biota-fapesp) project.

The data available here is the result of a 10-year Exclusion experiment of medium and large-sized mammals carried out by Dr. and Professor [**Mauro Galetti**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mauro-Galetti) and his lab (LaBiC â€“ Biology and Conservation laboratory).

This repository contains a data table with information about plot location, forest structure, seedlings diversity, herbivory, and morphological traits, seed predation, soil properties, and faunal biomass.

From the left navigation panel, you'll be able to access the descriptions, maps, and data and explore the data by using a linear regression plot, being able to choose the X and Y variables on the left side of this app. We also provide tools that allow you to choose between two different sampled years: 2017 and 2019. You can filter the data in the linear regression tab and download it by clicking at the bottom [**Download**] in the *Data Table* tab.

You can and should use this dataset for educational activities only.

For a quick walkthrough of the sample areas and experimental design please take a look at the video below.
