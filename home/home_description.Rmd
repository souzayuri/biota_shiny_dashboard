This dataset is part of the [*FAPESP-BIOTA*](https://fapesp.br/6259/biota-fapesp) project.

This dataset is the result of the 10-years of *Exclusion experiment of medium and large-sized mammals* administrated by Professor [**Mauro Galetti**](https://people.miami.edu/profile/mxr2210@miami.edu).

This repository contains a data table with information about plot location, forest structure, seedlings diversity, herbivory, and morphological traits, seed predation, soil properties, and faunal biomass. 

From the left navigation panel you'll be able to access the descriptions, maps, data and explore the data by a linear regression. You can explore our data table doing an interactive linear regression by choosing the X and Y variables on the left side of this app. We also provide tools that allow you to choose between two different sampling years: 2017 and 2019. You can filter the data in the linear regression tab and download it clicking at the bottom [**Download**] in the data tab.

You can and should use this dataset for educational activities only.

For a quick walkthrough about plot and area overview design have a look a the video below.
